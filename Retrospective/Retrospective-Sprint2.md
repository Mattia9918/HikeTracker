## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: **4/4**
- Total points committed vs. done:  **14/14**
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): **72h / 72h 45m**

**Definition of Done**:

- Unit Tests passing: **yes**
- Code review completed: **yes**
- Code present on VCS: **yes**
- End-to-End tests performed: **yes**

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   | 11 | - | 33h 30m | 39h 50m |
| #HT-4 | 6 | 3 | 13h 30m | 10h |
| #HT-5 | 6 | 3 | 7h 30m | 7h 35m |
| #HT-6 | 6 | 3 | 7h 30m | 6h 15m |
| #HT-7 | 6 | 5 | 10h | 9h 5m |

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual):

  - Average

    - **~2h 4m (estimated)**

    - **~2h 3m (actual)**

  - Standard deviation:
    - **~1.48 (estimated)**
    - **~1.82 (actual)**

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  1 - (72h / 72h 45m) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01 = **1%**
  
  
## QUALITY MEASURES

  - Total hours spent: **3h 50m**
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: **27**
  - Coverage (if available): **80%**
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: **6h**
  - Total hours spent: **5h**
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: **2h** 
  - Total hours spent: **1h 25m**
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  -  *Some tasks required a much lower effort than expected (ex. GUI mock-up wasn't required at all, since 3/4 of the tasks just required the development of forms on the client-side and it cold have been deducted by previous realized pages)* 
  - *Code adjustment task started requiring much more effort than expected, since it was necessary to repay part of the technical debt (bug fixing, code refactoring, project structure adjustments and features improvements) accumulated in the first sprint in order to faster proceed with the next stories.*

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - *Repaying the accumulated technical debt is a very important investment for future sprints, but it requires a lot of effort.*

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

  - ***Initial Planning**:*
    - *time related to estimation and assignment of tasks has not been included as a task in the sprint*
    - *initial planning has been performed immediately after the retrospective of the previous sprint* 

  - ***Cross-cutting tasks**: cross-cutting tasks assignment has been done after the user stories' assignment, according to the tasks that the team members had to work on.*

  - ***Git branch management**: the wrong branching management with which we collided in the previous sprint has been partially solved in this sprint*

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

  - *Initial planning took again too long (more than 2 hours)*

  - *Git branching management was better managed, but no specific cross-cutting task was explicitly added at the beginning of the sprint.* 

  - *Some cross-cutting tasks were still badly estimated due to:*
    - *lack of knowledge of the effects of technical debt on stories development*
    - *lack of an in-depth analysis of how the stories would be implemented*

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  - *Try to shorten initial planning to a maximum of 2h 30m*

  - *Technical debt management: we need to be able to do a better management of technical debt, also thanks to the tools we will have at our disposition (sonarcloud)*

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - *We were able to overcome project difficulties through communication! (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)*
