## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: **4/4**
- Total points committed vs. done:  **14/14**
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): **72h / 72h 45m**

**Definition of Done**:

- Unit Tests passing: **yes**
- Code review completed: **yes**
- Code present on VCS: **yes**
- End-to-End tests performed: **yes**

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   | 11 | - | 33h 30m | 39h 50m |
| #HT-4 | 6 | 3 | 13h 30m | 10h |
| #HT-5 | 6 | 3 | 7h 30m | 7h 35m |
| #HT-6 | 6 | 3 | 7h 30m | 6h 15m |
| #HT-7 | 6 | 5 | 10h | 9h 5m |

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual):

  - Average

    - **~2h 4m (estimated)**

    - **~2h 3m (actual)**

  - Standard deviation:
    - **~1.48 (estimated)**
    - **~1.82 (actual)**

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  1 - (72h / 72h 45m) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01 = **1%**
  
  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: **5h**
  - Total hours spent: **3h 50m**
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: **27**
  - Coverage (if available): **80%**
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: **6h**
  - Total hours spent: **5h**
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: **2h** 
  - Total hours spent: **1h 25m**
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
