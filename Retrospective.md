- [Process measures](#process-measures)
- [Quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [General assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: **3/3**
- Total points committed vs. done: **26/26**
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): **72h / 76h 25m**

**Remember **a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing: **yes**
- Code review completed: **yes**
- Code present on VCS: **yes**
- End-to-End tests performed: **yes** 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| #0 | 11 | - | 41h 30m | 39h 35m |
| HT-1 | 6 | 8 | 11h 30m | 14h 30m |
| HT-2  | 6 | 13 | 12h 30m | 14h 20m |
| HT-3 | 6 | 5 | 6h 30m | 8h 5m |


> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual): 

  - Hours per task average:
    - **~2h 30m (estimated)**
    - **~2h 38m (actual)**
  - Standard deviation:
    - **2.27 (estimated)**
    - **2.19 (actual)**

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  1 - (72h / 76h 25m) = 1 - 0.94 = 0.06 = **6%**
  
  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: **5h 30m**
  - Total hours spent: **6h 30m**
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: **9**
  - Coverage (if available): **70%**
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: **7h 30m**
  - Total hours spent: **6h 50m**
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: **2h 30m**
  - Total hours spent: **2h 10m**
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - *Cross-cutting tasks were, in some cases, over estimated. The reason was that they were always assigned to every team member (for example, Getting Familiar with new technologies), even if they were carried on by few members of the team.*
  - *Some development tasks (subtasks of user stories) were underestimated due to lack of experience.*
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - *An efficient Git branching management is a fundamental part of the team work.*
  - *It is fundamental to correctly estimate the time to learn and get used to new technologies.*
  - *Long group meetings (a part from Scrum meetings) can be dispersive and sometimes time consuming.*
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - ***Immediate setup**: set up was done within the first 2 days of sprint*
  - ***Better subdivision of the initial planning**: we created cross-cutting tasks for initial planning, also including: GUI mockup, APIs definition (resources involved, URIs, requests and all the possible responses), test planning (which kind of tests to write, which libraries to use).*
  - ***Closer team meetings over time**: at the end of each team meeting, we always defined the date and time of the next one*
  - ***Better planning of the testing phase**: we added tasks for Unit testing, E2E testing and code review*
  - ***Organize the demo**: we added a task to work on the demo presentation*
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  -  ***GUI mockup and API definition**: a task was added, but the discussion was not exhaustive*

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - ***Initial Planning**:* 
    - *time related to estimation and assignment of tasks should not be included as a task in the sprint*
    - *initial planning should be performed a soon as retrospective of the previous sprint is concluded and shouldn't take more than 2h*
  - ***Cross-cutting tasks**: cross-cutting tasks assignment should be done after and based on user stories' assignment, thus in some cases they concern only few team members.*
  - ***Git branch management**: add a task at the beginning of the sprint to discuss a better solution for team work in order to avoid version's conflicts.*

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

  *From the previous sprint, we improve a lot our efficiency and planning capabilities.*
